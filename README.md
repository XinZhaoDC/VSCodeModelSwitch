# VSCodeModelSwitch

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**VSCodeModelSwitch: an AI CLI provider switcher for VSCode.**

VSCodeModelSwitch is a VSCode extension for managing Claude Code and Codex providers, API endpoints, API keys, and models from a side-bar UI. It is built for AI coding users who frequently switch between API gateways, model vendors, proxies, and local test environments.

## Features

- Manage Claude Code and Codex providers separately
- Fetch model lists from provider endpoints
- Choose models from fetched lists instead of typing model names manually
- Show each provider as one compact row with quick `Apply`
- Refresh and change the model for each provider
- Show separate Claude and Codex provider/model status items in the VSCode status bar
- Watch config file changes and refresh status automatically
- Store API keys locally with VSCode SecretStorage
- Sync provider metadata with VSCode account sync
- Show `Key missing` and `Set Key` for synced providers without local secrets
- Import and export public config without secrets
- Write the active provider to real Claude Code and Codex config files by default
- Optional sandbox mode for safe testing

## Supported Tools

- Claude Code
- Codex

## Config Writes

By default, VSCodeModelSwitch writes active providers to your real machine config files:

```text
~/.claude/settings.json
~/.codex/config.toml
```

For safe testing, switch to sandbox mode:

```json
{
  "vscodemodelswitch.configTarget": "sandbox"
}
```

Sandbox mode writes to:

```text
<workspace>/.vscodemodelswitch-home
```

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Compile:

```bash
npm run compile
```

Run in VSCode:

1. Open this folder in VSCode.
2. Press `F5`.
3. In the Extension Development Host window, click the VSCodeModelSwitch Activity Bar icon.
4. Add a Claude Code or Codex provider.
5. Click `Fetch Models`.
6. Choose a model and save.
7. Click `Apply` on a provider row.

See `docs/validation.md` for the full local validation checklist.

## Mock Endpoint

Start the mock model server:

```bash
npm run mock:models
```

Use this endpoint for both Claude Code and Codex during testing:

```text
http://localhost:8787
```

Use any non-empty key, for example:

```text
test-key
```

## Settings

```json
{
  "vscodemodelswitch.globalCliSync": true,
  "vscodemodelswitch.configTarget": "real",
  "vscodemodelswitch.testHome": "",
  "vscodemodelswitch.anthropicVersion": "2023-06-01"
}
```

## Packaging

```bash
npm run package
```

## Notes

The status bar is based on the currently readable config files and matches saved providers by `baseUrl + model`. If another VSCode extension changes a model only in runtime memory without writing a config file or exposing a readable API, VSCodeModelSwitch cannot reliably read that in-memory state.
